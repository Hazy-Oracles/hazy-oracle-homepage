description: This work examines object hallucinations by measuring epistemic uncertainty in visual tokens. We show that visual uncertainty concentrates in hallucinated regions and propagates to text generation. To mitigate this, we propose a lightweight, training-free vision intervention that attenuates unreliable evidence, significantly improving grounding and reducing hallucinations.
